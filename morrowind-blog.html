        The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind is my Favorite Game of All Time. Though I have never beat the game! It has a way of a absorbing you into it's world. It's RPG elements and unforgiving difficulty is like no other game that came before it, or has came out since in my opinion. The lore and story telling the game displays to the character is all done mostly in text boxes when interacting with NPC's . With the player being able to pick a choice they would like to know more about. Blue highlighted and underlined <span class="blueUnderLined">text</span> will allow you to explore more about that certain topic. Unlocking more information that can lead you to other quests, or just a better understanding on the world around you.
